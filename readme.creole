= Sublime Package Control

A Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) package manager for easily
discovering, install, upgrading and removing packages. Also includes an
automatic updater and package creation tool.

Packages can be installed from GitHub, BitBucket or custom package repositories.
The plugin uses a channel and repository system to allow users to find new
packages over time without any work. It also supports working with packages that
were manually installed.

== Installation

Installation is through the Sublime Text 2 console. This is accessed via the ctrl+` shortcut. Once open, paste the following command into the console:

{{{
import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control (rivy).sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/rivy/ST2.pack.PackageControl/zipball/master'.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation'
}}}

This command creates the Installed Packages folder for you (if necessary), and then downloads the Package Control.sublime-package into it.
